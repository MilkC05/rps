Thank you for taking the time to read this and my code.

I am new to C++ and have a small amount of prior experience (Python and PowerShell) and I only read through the first few parts of learncpp.com.

I wanted to challenge myself a little bit by trying to make this game from scratch 
with no tutorials and just what I thought would work.

Please leave some feedback on what is wrong and what is right. It would be greatly appreciated as this is just the beginning of my journey learning C++.
